# RustKeep

Rust password generator and keeper, plans to eventually add a TUI implementation but for now this will work in the terminal and will be generated straight to an encrypted file

----------------------------

# TODO

[] Create random password generator from scratch<br>
[] Write passwords to file<br>
[] Encrypt file with master password<br>
[] Create a TUI that will be used for this<br> 
[] Optimize and make secure as possible<br> 

----------------------------

# Contributing

## Please keep in mind that if you're planning to contribute to this, although I doubt that you will.... their are certain things that are expected.

### Expectations: Please Read

<p>You are expected to maintain the **same** quality of code that I have attempted to write. Understand that I am new to Rust and if you have a better grasp of the language than I do, that is great but this likely going to be implemented mostly without the use of any crates besides something to use for a TUI.... eventually. <br> **DO** Contribute to this like it's your own project. Ensure that at the very least you're attempting to write secure and maintainable code. Comments aren't entirely necessary unless there is something that is so complex that I will have to go back and write comments for it myself because it's hard to understand. <br> **DO NOT** Just write whatever you want, if there is an issue that you feel is necessary to bring up, then feel free to make an issue for it first and I'll have a look.</p>

### TO Contribute

Make an issue, wait til I comment that it's something that can be added, fork the repo and open a PR, it's that simple really. If this project for some reason gains traction, I will decide how to maintain it after so much time. Thanks and LGTM. :D
